# Portfolio  

Hey 👋 I’m **Khoa Pham Duy Dang** (but you can call me **Kyle**).  

I’m a web developer who loves turning ideas into interactive, pixel-perfect experiences. With **5+ years in the field**, I’ve learned that building great software isn’t just about writing clean code – it’s about **designing smooth user journeys, solving real problems, and adding just enough flair to keep things fun.**

## 💡 About Me  

I started my coding journey about five years ago, and since then, I’ve been obsessed with how design and technology collide. Whether it’s **polishing a UI until it feels buttery-smooth** or **digging deep into the backend to optimize performance**, I’m all about creating things that people *enjoy using*.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably catch me:  
- Geeking out about the latest frontend frameworks  
- Breaking (and fixing) side projects at 2 AM  
- Playing around with UI/UX tweaks that nobody asked for (but secretly loves)
